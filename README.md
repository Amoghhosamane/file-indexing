File Indexing System
--------------------

A Computer Science Mini Project & Self-Development Full-Stack Learning Project

Project Description
-------------------

File-Indexing is a full-stack application built as a Computer Science mini-project and also as a self-development project to improve real-world development skills.

This system lets users:
- Upload files
- Store metadata
- Retrieve indexed files
- Manage and organize files efficiently

It demonstrates understanding of frontend development, backend APIs, routing, file handling, and monorepo structure.

The project is structured as a frontend + backend system, built inside one combined monorepo folder (FILE-INDEXING/).

Purpose of the Project
----------------------

This project was created for two goals:

1. Computer Science Mini-Project
   - Demonstrates practical full-stack skills
   - Implements REST API + frontend integration
   - Shows knowledge of file processing
   - Can be submitted for academic project work

2. Self Development
   - Improve real-world coding skills
   - Learn how to structure a full-stack app
   - Learn API communication, CORS, routing
   - Practice GitHub version control
   - Build a portfolio-ready project

Features
--------

Backend (Node.js + Express):
- File upload using multer
- File metadata storage
- REST API endpoints
- CORS enabled for frontend requests
- Debug logs for development

Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript):
- Clean UI
- File upload form
- API integration via proxy
- Environment variable support
- CSP security headers configured

Full-Stack Setup:
- Monorepo structure (frontend/ + backend/)
- Next.js rewrites mapped to backend API
- Environment variable support
- Easy to run locally
